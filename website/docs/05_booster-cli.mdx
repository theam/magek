# Booster CLI

The Booster CLI is a command line interface that helps you develop and deploy your Booster applications. It is built with Node.js and published to NPM through the package `@booster-ai/cli`. It's automatically included as a dependency in every Booster project - no global installation required!

## No Installation Required

When you create a Booster project using `npm create booster-ai@latest`, the CLI is automatically included as a dependency. Simply use `npx boost` to run any CLI command within your project directory.

<TerminalWindow>

```bash
# Create a new project (CLI automatically included)
npm create booster-ai@latest my-project

# Navigate to your project and start using the CLI
cd my-project
npx boost --help
```

</TerminalWindow>

## Usage

Once you're in your Booster project directory, you can use the `npx boost` command to see the help message.

:::tip
You can also run `npx boost --help` to get the same output.
