# Installation

You can develop with Booster using any of the following operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows (Native and WSL)

## Booster Prerequisites

### Install Node.js

The latest version of Booster (`3.x`) requires the current LTS version of Node.js which is `20.x`. Booster releases with versions `2.x` will only work with the previous Node.js LTS version (`18.x`).

:::info
For more information on upgrades between Booster v2.x.x and v3.x.x, read [this page](https://github.com/boostercloud/booster/blob/main/upgrade-v3.md).

For more information on upgrades between Booster v1.x.x and v2.x.x, read [this page](https://github.com/boostercloud/booster/blob/main/upgrade-v2.md).
:::

Download the installer [from Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/), or install it using your system's package
manager.

<!-- For some strange reason, when using tabs, you need to remove the ident on the content -->

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, run the following command in your PowerShell

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
choco install nodejs
```

</TerminalWindow>


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager, run the following command on the terminal

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
brew install node
```

</TerminalWindow>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">
  
Just run the following commands on the terminal:

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```

</TerminalWindow>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that it was installed properly by checking so from your terminal:

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
node -v
```

> v14.14.0

```shell
npm -v
```

> 7.0.0

</TerminalWindow>

As soon as you have a Node.js version higher than `v14.14`, and an `npm` version higher than
`7`, you are good to go. Just note that `npm` comes with node, you don't have to install
it apart.

Alternatively, we recommend you to use a version manager for dealing with different Node.js
versions:

- [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Works with macOS, Linux, and Windows Subsystem
  for Linux
- [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - Works with native Windows

### Install Git

Booster will initialize a Git repository when you create a new project (unless you use the `--skipGit` flag), so it is required that you have it already installed in your system.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
choco install git
```

</TerminalWindow>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
brew install git
```

</TerminalWindow>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
sudo apt install git-all
```

</TerminalWindow>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Git configuration variables

After installing git in your machine, make sure that `user.name` and `user.email` are properly configured.
Take a look at the [Git configuration page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) for more info.

To configure them, run in your terminal:

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"
```

</TerminalWindow>


## Creating Projects and Installing the Booster CLI

### Quick Start: No Installation Required

To create a new Booster project, you don't need to install anything, if you have node installed in your machine, you can run:

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
npm create booster-ai@latest my-project
```

</TerminalWindow>

This command will create a new project using the latest version without requiring any global installations.

### Installing the Booster CLI (No Global Installation Required)

For project development after creation, Booster includes the CLI as a dependency in your project. There's no need for global installation - the CLI is automatically available via `npx` after creating your project.

When you create a project using `npm create booster-ai@latest`, the CLI is added as a dependency and can be used immediately:

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
cd my-project
npm install
npx boost version
```

</TerminalWindow>

Verify the Booster CLI installation with the `npx boost version` command. You should get back something like

<TerminalWindow>

```shell
npx boost version
```

> @magek/cli/0.16.1 darwin-x64 node-v14.14.0

</TerminalWindow>

:::tip
The CLI is automatically included in every Booster project - no global installation needed! Use `npx boost` for all CLI commands within your project directory.
