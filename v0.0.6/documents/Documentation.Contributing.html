The criteria to split the code in packages is that each package meets at least one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must be run separately, for instance, the CLI is run locally, while the server code runs as a standalone server or serverless function.</li>
<li>They contain code that is used by at least two of the other packages.</li>
<li>They're an adapter implementation of some abstract part of the framework (for instance, the storage adapter packages).</li>
</ul>
<p>The packages are managed using <a href="https://rushjs.io/">rush</a> and <a href="https://npmjs.com">npm</a>, if you run <code>rush build</code>, it will build all the packages.</p>
<p>The packages are published to <code>npmjs</code> under the prefix <code>@magek/</code>, their purpose is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cli</code> - You guessed it! This package is the <code>magek</code> command-line tool, it interacts only with the core package in order to load the project configuration.</li>
<li><code>core</code> - This one contains all the framework runtime logic. Stuff like the generation of the config or the commands and events handling happens here.</li>
<li><code>server</code> - Local development server with Fastify-based HTTP, WebSocket, SSE support, and all infrastructure components.</li>
<li><code>common</code> - This package defines shared types and helpers used across all other packages. It includes the main Magek concepts like:
<ul>
<li>Entity</li>
<li>Command</li>
<li>etc…</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a dependency graph that shows the dependencies among all packages, including the application using Magek:

<h4 id="documentation-principles-and-practices" class="tsd-anchor-link">Documentation principles and practices<a href="#documentation-principles-and-practices" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h4><p>The ultimate goal of a technical document is to translate the knowledge from the technology creators into the reader's mind so that they learn. The challenging
part here is the one in which they learn. It is challenging because, under the same amount of information, a person can suffer an information overload because
we (humans) don't have the same information-processing capacity. That idea is going to work as our compass, it should drive our efforts so people with less
capacity is still able to follow and understand our documentation.</p>
<p>To achieve our goal we propose writing documentation following these principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clean and Clear</li>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Coherent</li>
<li>Explicit</li>
<li>Attractive</li>
<li>Inclusive</li>
<li>Cohesive</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="principles" class="tsd-anchor-link">Principles<a href="#principles" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h5><p><strong>1. Clean and Clear</strong></p>
<p>Less is more. Apple is, among many others, a good example of creating clean and clear content, where visual elements are carefully chosen to look beautiful
(e.g. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">Apple's swift UI</a>) and making the reader getting the point as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The intention of every section, paragraph, and sentence must be clear, we should avoid writing details of two different things even when they are related.
It is better to link pages and keep the focus and the intention clear, Wikipedia is the best example on this.</p>
<p><strong>2. Simple</strong></p>
<p>Technical writings deal with different backgrounds and expertise from the readers. We should not assume the reader knows everything we are talking about
but we should not explain everything in the same paragraph or section. Every section has a goal to stick to the goal and link to internal or external resources
to go deeper.</p>
<p>Diagrams are great tools, you know a picture is worth more than a thousand words unless that picture contains too much information.
Keep it simple intentionally omitting details.</p>
<p><strong>3. Coherent</strong></p>
<p>The documentation tells a story. Every section should integrate naturally without making the reader switch between different contexts. Text, diagrams,
and code examples should support each other without introducing abrupt changes breaking the reader’s flow. Also, the font, colors, diagrams, code samples,
animations, and all the visual elements we include, should support the story we are telling.</p>
<p><strong>4. Explicit</strong></p>
<p>Go straight to the point without assuming the readers should know about something. Again, link internal or external resources to clarify.</p>
<p>The index of the whole content must be visible all the time so the reader knows exactly where they are and what is left.</p>
<p><strong>5. Attractive</strong></p>
<p>Our text must be nice to read, our diagrams delectable to see, and our site… a feast for the eyes!!</p>
<p><strong>6. Inclusive</strong></p>
<p>Everybody should understand our writings, especially the topics at the top. We have arranged the documentation structure in a way that anybody can dig
deeper by just going down so, sections 1 to 4 must be suitable for all ages.</p>
<p>Use gender-neutral language to avoid the use of he, him, his to refer to undetermined gender. It is better to use their or they as a gender-neutral
approach than s/he or similars.</p>
<p><strong>7. Cohesive</strong></p>
<p>Writing short and concise sentences is good, but remember to use proper connectors (“Therefore”, “Besides”, “However”, “thus”, etc) that provide a
sense of continuation to the whole paragraph. If not, when people read the paragraphs, their internal voice sounds like a robot with unnatural stops.</p>
<p>For example, read this paragraph and try to hear your internal voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entities are created on the fly, by reducing the whole event stream. You shouldn't assume that they are stored anywhere.  Magek does create
automatic snapshots to make the reduction process efficient. You are the one in charge of writing the reducer function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now read this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entities are created on the fly by reducing the whole event stream. While you shouldn't assume that they are stored anywhere,  Magek does create automatic
snapshots to make the reduction process efficient. In any case, this is opaque to you and the only thing you should care is to provide the reducer function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you feel the difference? The latter makes you feel that everything is connected, it is more cohesive.</p>
<h5 id="practices" class="tsd-anchor-link">Practices<a href="#practices" aria-label="Permalink" class="tsd-anchor-icon"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true"><use href="../assets/icons.svg#icon-anchor"></use></svg></a></h5><p>There are many writing styles depending on the type of document. It is common within technical and scientific writing to use Inductive and/or Deductive styles
for paragraphs. They have different outcomes and one style may suit better in one case or another, that is why it is important to know them, and decide which
one to use in every moment. Let’s see the difference with 2 recursive examples.</p>
<p><strong>Deductive paragraphs ease the reading for advanced users but still allows you to elaborate on ideas and concepts for newcomers</strong>. In deductive paragraphs,
the conclusions or definitions appear at the beginning, and then, details, facts, or supporting phrases complete the paragraph’s idea. By placing the
conclusion in the first sentence, the reader immediately identifies the main point so they can decide to skip the whole paragraph or keep reading.
If you take a look at the structure of this paragraph, it is deductive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to drive the readers' attention and play with it as if they were in a roller coaster, you can do so by using a different approach.
In that approach, you first introduce the facts and ideas and then you wrap them with a conclusion. This style is more narrative and forces the reader to
continue because the main idea is diluted in the whole paragraph. Once all the ideas are placed together, you can finally conclude the paragraph. <strong>This style is
called Inductive.</strong></p>
<p>The first paragraph is deductive and the last one is inductive. In general, it is better to use the deductive style, but if we stick to one, our writing will start looking weird and maybe boring.
So decide one or another being conscious about your intention.</p>

There are several &quot;package.json&quot; files and each one has its purpose with regard to the dependencies you include on them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;package.json&quot; files that are on each package root should contain the dependencies used by that specific package. Be sure to correctly differentiate which dependency is only for development and which one is for production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <strong>always use exact numbers for dependency versions</strong>. This means that if you want to add the dependency &quot;graphql&quot; in version 1.2.3, you should add <code>&quot;graphql&quot;: &quot;1.2.3&quot;</code> to the corresponding &quot;package.json&quot; file, and never <code>&quot;graphql&quot;: &quot;^1.2.3&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;graphql&quot;: &quot;~1.2.3&quot;</code>. This restriction comes from hard problems we've had in the past.</p>

If you want to run the unit tests for an especific package, you should move to the corresponding folder and run one of the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>rushx test:cli -v</code>: Run unit tests for the <code>cli</code> package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rushx test:core -v</code>: Run unit tests for the <code>core</code> package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rushx test:server -v</code>: Run unit tests for the <code>server</code> package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>rushx test:common -v</code>: Run unit tests for the <code>common</code> package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>doc/*</code> - PR that enhances the documentation</p>
</li>

<pre><code class="text">&lt;commit type&gt;([optional scope]): &lt;description&gt;

<p>As an example:</p>
<pre><code class="text">fix(cli): Correct minor typos in code
</code><button type="button">Copy</button></pre>

<p>The most important kind of commits are the ones that trigger version bumps and therefore a new release in the CI/CD system:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fix</code> - patch version bump (<code>0.0.x</code>)</li>
<li><code>feat</code> - minor version bump (<code>0.x.0</code>)</li>
<li>Any commit type followed by <code>!</code>, i.e. <code>feat!</code> - major version bump (<code>x.0.0</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from those previously mentioned, there are more commit types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>build</strong>: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: rush, tsconfig, npm)</li>
<li><strong>ci</strong>: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts</li>
<li><strong>docs</strong>: Documentation only changes</li>
<li><strong>feat</strong>: A new feature</li>
<li><strong>fix</strong>: A bug fix</li>
<li><strong>perf</strong>: A code change that improves performance</li>
<li><strong>refactor</strong>: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature</li>
<li><strong>style</strong>: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)</li>
<li><strong>test</strong>: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests</li>
</ul>
<p>We're using the following scopes in the project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cli</strong></li>
<li><strong>core</strong></li>
<li><strong>common</strong></li>
<li><strong>server</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart of using conventional commits for triggering releases, we use them to build the project changelog.</p>

You can also run the <code>rush run lint:fix</code> commands to try solving any linter problems automatically.</p>
<p>For everything else, the rule of thumb is: Try to be consistent with the code around yours, and if you're not sure, ask :-)</p>
<p>There are some things that the linter doesn't force but are preferred this way:</p>
